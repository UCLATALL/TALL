    authors: Icy (Yunyi) Zhang, Maureen E. Gray, Alicia (Xiaoxuan) Cheng, Ji Y. Son, and James W. Stigler
    year: 2023
    filename: representation-mapping.pdf
    abstract: The present study developed a representation-mapping intervention designed to help students interpret, coordinate, and eventually translate across multiple representations. We integrated the intervention into an online textbook being used in a college course, allowing us to study its impact in a real course over an extended period of time. The findings of this study support the efficacy of the representation-mapping intervention for facilitating learning and shed light on how to implement and refine such interventions in authentic learning contexts.

    year: 2023
    filename: Burrill 2023 Common Ground.pdf
    abstract: Solutions to pressing and complex social challenges require that we reach for common ground. Only through cooperation among people with a broad range of backgrounds and expertise can progress be made on issues as challenging as improving student success in mathematics. In this spirit, the AMS Committee on Education held a forum in May 2022 entitled The Evolving Curriculum in High School and Early Undergraduate Mathematical Sciences Education. This article is a report on that forum by the authors listed above, who were among the organizers and presenters.

    authors: Danny Rahal, Stacy T. Shaw, James W. Stigler 
    year: 2023
    filename: Lower socioeconomic status.pdf
    abstract: "People of lower social status tend to have greater emotional responses to stress. This study assessed whether lower social status was related to greater emotional responses in anticipation of a naturalistic stressor: academic exams among college students. As hypothesized, multilevel models (ratings nested within participants) predicting emotion indicated that students with lower mother’s education had less positive emotion, more depressive emotion, and more anxious emotion the day prior to academic exams than students with higher mother’s education (proportional reductions in variance [PRV] = .013–.020). Specifically, lower mother’s education was associated with poorer well-being before but not after the exam. Exploratory models revealed that differences in emotion by mother’s education were strongest for students with lower exam scores (PRV = .030–.040)."

    authors: Mary C. Tucker, Stacy T. Shaw, Ji Y. Son & James W. Stigler
    journal: Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education
    year: 2022
    filename: Tucker 2022 Teaching Statistics.pdf
    abstract: In this exploratory study, we characterize the attitudes and experiences of 672 undergraduate students as they used our online textbook as part of a 10-week introductory course in statistics. Students expressed negative attitudes and concerns related to R at the beginning of the course, but most developed more positive attitudes after engaging with course materials, regardless of demographic characteristics or prior programming experience. Analysis of a subgroup of students revealed that change in attitudes toward Rmay be linked to students’ patterns of engagement over time and students’ perceptions of the learning environment.

    authors: Claudia C. Sutter, Karen B. Givvin, Mary C. Tucker, Kathryn A. Givvin, Ana Leandro-Ramos & Paige L. Solomon
    journal: Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education
    year: 2022
    filename: Student Concerns and Perceived Challenges in Introductory Statistics How the Frequency Shifted during COVID 19 and How They Differ by Subgroups of.pdf
    abstract: We explored how the frequency of concerns changed with the onset of COVID-19(N=1417) and, during COVID-19, how incoming concerns compared to later perceived challenges(n=524).Students were most concerned about R coding, understanding concepts, workload, prior knowledge,time management, and performance, with each of these concerns mentioned less frequently during thanbefore COVID-19. Concerns most directly related to the pandemic—virtual learning and inaccessibility of resources—showed an increase in frequency. The frequency of concerns differed by gender and URM status.The most frequently mentioned challenges were course workload, virtual learning, R coding, and under-standing concepts, with significant differences by URM status. Concerns about understanding concepts,lack of prior knowledge, performance, and time management declined from the beginning to the end of theterm. Workload had the highest rate of both consistency and emergence across the term. 
    
  - name: <span style="color:red">Watching a Hands-on Activity Improves Students’ Understanding of Randomness</span>
    authors: Icy (Yunyi) Zhang, Mary Tucker, James W. Stigler
    journal: Computer & Education
    year: 2022
    filename: Watching a hands-on activity improves students’ understanding of randomness.pdf
    abstract: Given the growing interest in using statistical programming languages like R as pedagogical tools, the findings of this study provide important and encouraging insights into the use of hands-on demonstrations to complement computer simulation in remote teaching. It validates the importance of giving students some hands-on exposure to the simulation processes prior to the compu- tational simulation we want them to understand and makes it clear that at least some of the benefits of embodied activities can be retained even if students are not performing the hands-on activities themselves.

    authors: Cindy Xiong, Elsie Lee-Robbins, Icy Zhang, Aimen Gaba, Steven Franconeri
    journal: IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics.
    year: 2022
    filename: Reasoning_Affordances_with_Tables_and_Bar_Charts.pdf
    abstract: We tested whether confirmation bias exists when people reason with visualized data and whether certain visualization designs can elicit less biased reasoning strategies. We asked crowdworkers to solve reasoning problems that had the potential to evoke both poor reasoning strategies and confirmation bias. Presenting the data in a table format helped participants reason with the correct ratio strategy while showing the data as a bar table or a bar chart led participants towards incorrect heuristics. Confirmation bias was not significantly present when beliefs were primed, but it was present when beliefs were pre-existing. Additionally, the table presentation format was more likely to afford the ratio reasoning strategy, and the use of ratio strategy was more likely to lead to the correct answer. 
    
  - name: <span style="color:red">Effect of Feedback with Video-based Peer Modeling on Learning and Self-efficacy</span>
    authors: Wadi Eghterafi, Mary C. Tucker, Icy (Yunyi) Zhang, Ji Y. Son
    journal: Online Learning Journal
    year: 2022
    filename: Eghterafi_2022.pdf
    abstract: In this study, we examined the effect of video-based feedback designed to highlight a peer engaging in effective thinking processes on self-efficacy beliefs and learning outcomes (performance on a delayed quiz). Results indicated that students who watched the mastery videos, but not the coping videos, rated their self-efficacy higher and scored higher on a class quiz taken more than a day after the feedback intervention than students who viewed a worked example. 
   
  - name: <span style="color:red">Modeling First Applying Learning Science to the Teaching of Introductory Statistics</span>
    authors: Ji Y. Son, Adam Blake, Laura Fries, James W. Stigler
    journal: Journal of Statistics Education
    year: 2021
    filename: Modeling First.pdf
    abstract: In this article we describe our attempt to apply theories and findings from learning science to the design of a statistics course that aims to help students build a coherent and interconnected representation of the domain. The resulting practicing connections approach provides students with repeated opportunities to practice connections between core concepts (especially the concepts of statistical model, distribution, and randomness), key representations (R programming language and computational techniques such as simulation and bootstrapping), and real-world situations statisticians face as they explore variation, model variation, and evaluate and compare statistical models. We provide a guided tour through our curriculum implemented in an interactive online textbook (CourseKata.org) and then provide some evidence that students who complete the course are able to transfer what they have learned to the learning of new statistical techniques.
