    position: Grad Student
    email: stacy.tamsen.shaw@gmail.com
    intro: Stacy is largely interested in creative thinking in STEM, with an emphasis on how students make connections across concepts, and how affective factors (e.g., math anxiety) impact students' ability to think flexibly about concepts. Currently, she is researching how students reach mathematical insights in their everyday lives, with the aim of understanding how deep immersive periods of conscious work may affect later Aha! moments. In her work with the Better Book project, she is interested in how individual and group differences relate to student engagement, and how opportunities to make connections across statistical concepts fosters learning.

    position: Lab Assistant
    email: zhang_yunyi@outlook.com
    intro: I’m interested in teaching and learning in general. My work in my undergraduate years has been focused on the effect of gesture on students’ learning of abstract concepts such as statistics from instructional videos. The reason for conducting those work is that I’m passionate about developing efficient instructive method to better engage students in online teaching materials. I’m now working in the lab as a full-time lab assistant, conducting research as well as helping the development of the Better Book project.
